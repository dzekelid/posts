  title: Stack Exchange Get Post
  description: "Fetches a set of posts by ids.\n \nThis method is meant for grabbing
    an object when unsure whether an id identifies a question or an answer. This is
    most common with user entered data.\n \n{ids} can contain up to 100 semicolon
    delimited ids, to find ids programatically look for post_id, answer_id, or question_id
    on post, answer, and question objects respectively.\n \nThe sorts accepted by
    this method operate on the follow fields of the post object:\n - activity - last_activity_date\n
    - creation - creation_date\n - votes - score\n  activity is the default sort.\n
    \n It is possible to create moderately complex queries using sort, min, max, fromdate,
    and todate.\n \nThis method returns a list of posts."

        many ways this method is the union of /questions and /answers, returning both
        sets of data albeit only the common fields.\n \nMost applications should use
        the question or answer specific methods, but /posts is available for those
        rare cases where any activity is of intereset. Examples of such queries would
        be: \"all posts on Jan. 1st 2011\" or \"top 10 posts by score of all time\".\n
