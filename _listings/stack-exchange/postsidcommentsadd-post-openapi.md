        many ways this method is the union of /questions and /answers, returning both
        sets of data albeit only the common fields.\n \nMost applications should use
        the question or answer specific methods, but /posts is available for those
        rare cases where any activity is of intereset. Examples of such queries would
        be: \"all posts on Jan. 1st 2011\" or \"top 10 posts by score of all time\".\n
        \nThe sorts accepted by this method operate on the follow fields of the post
        object:\n - activity - last_activity_date\n - creation - creation_date\n -
        votes - score\n  activity is the default sort.\n \n It is possible to create
        moderately complex queries using sort, min, max, fromdate, and todate.\n \nThis
