        Posts a bulletin for a specific channel. (The user submitting the request must be authorized to act on the channel's behalf.)

        Note: Even though an activity resource can contain information about actions like a user rating a video or marking a video as a favorite, you need to use other API methods to generate those activity resources. For example, you would use the API's videos.rate() method to rate a video and the playlistItems.insert() method to mark a video as a favorite.
